![Airport_Satisfaction](https://airport-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Smiley_Touch_buttonpress-branded_close_EN-scaled.jpg) 

## Overview

This dataset provides information on airline passengers' satisfaction levels based on various factors related to their travel experiences. It includes data on gender, customer type, age, type of travel, travel class, flight distance, and satisfaction ratings for different aspects of the journey. The dataset also contains information about departure and arrival delays. The goal is to use this data to understand the factors influencing passenger satisfaction and build predictive models to assess and improve airline services.

## Background

Understanding and improving passenger satisfaction is a crucial goal for airlines. This dataset aims to analyze passenger satisfaction levels and identify factors that contribute to or detract from a positive travel experience. Airlines can leverage this information to enhance services and optimize customer satisfaction.

## Data Description

### Data Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Gender:** Gender of the passengers (Female, Male).
- **Customer Type:** Customer type (Loyal customer, Disloyal customer).
- **Age:** The actual age of the passengers.
- **Type of Travel:** Purpose of the flight (Personal Travel, Business Travel).
- **Class:** Travel class in the plane (Business, Eco, Eco Plus).
- **Flight Distance:** The flight distance for the journey (in miles).
- **Inflight Services:** Satisfaction ratings for various inflight services (e.g., wifi, departure/arrival time convenience, online booking, gate location, food and drink, etc.).
- **Departure/Arrival Delay in Minutes:** Duration of departure and arrival delays (in minutes).
- **Satisfaction:** Airline satisfaction level (Satisfaction, Neutral, Dissatisfaction).

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction]. Please refer to the original source for additional information and citation requirements.

## Data Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset may require preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Preprocessing ensures that the data is ready for analysis and modeling.

## Predictive Modeling

The dataset can be used for predictive modeling to build models that predict passenger satisfaction levels based on the provided features. Machine learning techniques such as regression or classification can be applied to create predictive models.
